# Meet-and-Seat
*Meet & Seat lets you find out about interesting people who will be on board your flight such as other passengers attending the same event as you at your destination.
Simply share your Facebook or LinkedIn profile details to check other participating passengers’ details and where they'll be sitting. Of course you can also choose your seat.*

### How does it work:
 ###### 1. Log in to your Facebook or LinkedIn account.
 ###### 2. Select the profile details you want to share with other passengers and add your travel details.

 #### Next, the seat map will show you:
 
 ###### --Other participating passengers’ profile details.
 ###### --Which seat they have chosen.
 ###### --Which seats are available: you can select a seat, for example, next to someone with similar interests – and change as often as you like.

#### Profile and privacy: 
*You can always choose to show less or more profile details or remove your profile details from the seat map entirely. We will not use your profile details for other purposes than Meet & Seat. We will not share your details with third parties either.*


#### Your seat:
*When sharing your details via Meet & Seat, you can change your seat as often as you like and arrange extra comfortable seats in Economy Class. If you choose to remove your profile from Meet & Seat, your seat number will remain the same, but you can still change it as often as you like without using Meet & Seat.*

Meet and Seat is a feature already in use by KLM (Royal Dutch Airlines) and I am trying to rebuild it (not entirelly) in my app so that local users can also benefit from this awesome service!
